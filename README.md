## PyTorch Installation
To install PyTorch with GPU support, refer to the official page from PyTorch [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Or just run the code below in your virtual environment.

```
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=<YOUR_CUDA_VERSION> -c pytorch -c conda-forge
```

Keep in mind that you will need a compatible CUDA version to work with PyTorch GPU. You can check whether you have installed CUDA or not by checking the existence of any folder inside `"C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA"` (for Windows, I am not sure about Linux), you should see a folder named with CUDA version, e.g. `v11.0` for CUDA version 11.0. You may download and install CUDA from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) if you haven't done so yet. 

NOTE: If you have used TensorFlow with GPU support before, then you have already installed CUDA and cuDNN, if not, you may refer to how to install them in this YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/hHWkvEcDBO0) (without installing the TensorFlow in the same environment of course, since we are using PyTorch here).

If you get an error as shown below:
```
ImportError: DLL load failed while importing win32api: The specified module could not be found.
```
Then you need to run the following commands below to uninstall and reinstall `pywin32`, the uninstall command might tell you that `pywin32` is not found but it's ok, just proceed to the next command.
```
pip uninstall pywin32
conda uninstall pywin32
conda install pywin32
```

## Package Installation
Just run the following command to install the rest of the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
